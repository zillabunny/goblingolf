# Social & SEO Implementation Skill

Implement comprehensive SEO and social sharing capabilities for any web-based project. See [reference.md](reference.md) for detailed templates, code snippets, and platform-specific notes.

## Arguments

- `phase1` - Foundation only (meta tags, social card, robots.txt, sitemap)
- `phase2` - Foundation + Enhancement (adds structured data, share buttons, and optionally PWA)
- `phase3` - All phases including shareable result links
- `all` - Same as phase3
- No argument - Ask user which phases to implement

## Step 1: Gather Required Information

Before implementing, collect this information from the user:

| Information | Example | Used For |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Site name | "My Site" | Title, OG tags, structured data |
| Site type | game, app, art/gallery, blog, personal/portfolio, business, docs | Structured data, content templates |
| Tagline | "A Short Tagline" | Meta description, social cards |
| Full description | "A compelling 150-char description..." | Meta description (150-160 chars) |
| Production domain | mysite.example.com | Canonical URL, OG URLs, sitemap |
| Brand/Site name | "My Studio" or "Luna Gallery" | og:site_name |
| Author/Creator name | "Jane Doe" or "My Studio" | JSON-LD author (can be same as brand) |
| Author type | Person or Organization | JSON-LD `@type` for author |
| Primary brand color | #3b82f6 | theme-color, PWA colors |
| Secondary/background color | #1e40af | PWA background_color |

**Additional info by site type** (ask only what's relevant):

| Site Type | Also Ask |
|-----------|----------|
| Game | Genre (e.g., Puzzle, Strategy), play mode (SinglePlayer/MultiPlayer), studio website URL |
| App | Application category (e.g., Productivity, Finance, Education), author website URL |
| Art/Gallery | Art medium/form (e.g., Digital Art, Photography), social media profile URLs |
| Personal/Portfolio | Job title, key skills, social media profile URLs (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.) |
| Business | Contact email, social media profile URLs |
| Blog | Author bio URL, social media profile URLs |

Use AskUserQuestion to gather any missing information. **Site type** is important - it determines which structured data schema, content patterns, and additional info to collect.

**Title/description length**: If the natural title is under 50 chars or description under 150 chars, that's fine — don't pad artificially. The ranges (50-60, 150-160) are maximums to avoid truncation, not minimums to hit.

## Step 2: Determine Project Structure

1. Find the main HTML file (usually `index.html`)
2. Identify existing `<head>` content to preserve — do not duplicate tags that already exist
3. Note the project root for asset placement

**Framework note:** For framework-based sites (React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, Next.js, etc.), meta tags may need to go in a layout component or framework-specific head management (e.g., `next/head`, `svelte:head`, Astro frontmatter) rather than a raw HTML file. Static assets still go in the public/root directory.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Essential)

### 1.1 HTML Meta Tags

Add to `<head>` (ensure `<html lang="en">` is set):

```html
<!-- Basic SEO -->
<title>[Site Name] - [Tagline]</title>
<meta name="description" content="[150-160 char description]">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://[domain]">
<meta name="theme-color" content="[primary-color]">

<!-- Favicon (ICO for legacy, SVG for modern browsers with dark mode support) -->
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="32x32">
<link rel="icon" href="icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png">

<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://[domain]">
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">
<meta property="og:title" content="[Site Name] - [Tagline]">
<meta property="og:description" content="[Description]">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://[domain]/social-card.jpg">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="[Alt text - describe what is visually shown, not the site's purpose]">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="[Brand Name]">

<!-- Twitter/X (twitter:url is unnecessary - X derives it from the shared link) -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="[Site Name] - [Tagline]">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="[Description]">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://[domain]/social-card.jpg">
<meta name="twitter:image:alt" content="[Alt text]">
```

### 1.2 Create Social Card Image (1200x630)

**Using the pre-configured Playwright browser control (preferred method):**

> **Do NOT install Playwright from npm or write Playwright scripts.** Use only the
> browser control tools already configured in this environment — either Playwright
> MCP tools (e.g. `browser_navigate`, `browser_screenshot`) or Playwright CLI
> commands (e.g. `playwright-cli open`, `playwright-cli screenshot`), whichever is
> available.

1. Create `social-card.html` with project colors/branding (see [reference.md S1.3](reference.md#13-social-card-image) for HTML template)
2. Capture using the pre-configured browser control tools:
   - Navigate to `file:///[path]/social-card.html`
   - Resize the viewport to 1200 x 630
   - Take a screenshot, saving as `social-card.png`
3. Convert to JPG: `magick social-card.png -quality 85 social-card.jpg` (or `convert` on ImageMagick 6)
4. Clean up: delete `social-card.html` and `social-card.png` (keep the HTML if the user may want to iterate on the design later)

**If no browser control tools are available:** Ask the user to provide a social card image (1200x630 JPG), or create one using an external design tool and place it in the project root as `social-card.jpg`.

### 1.3 Create Icon Files

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `favicon.ico` | 32x32 | Legacy browsers, search results |
| `icon.svg` | Scalable | Modern browsers (supports dark mode) |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | 180x180 | iOS home screen |

**What to put in the icon:** Use the site's initial letter or a simple symbol in the primary brand color. If a logo already exists in the project, use that. Keep it recognizable at 32x32.

**Simple geometric icons:** Write SVG directly. **Complex graphics:** Use browser control tools to screenshot HTML at each size. **Transparency:** Set HTML/body background to `transparent`, use PNG format. See [reference.md S1.5](reference.md#15-icon-files) for details.

### 1.4 Search Engine Files

**Before creating `robots.txt`, ask the user these questions:**

1. **"Are there any paths or directories that should be hidden from search engines?"** (e.g., `/admin`, `/api`, `/staging`, `/drafts`, private asset folders). Most single-page sites can use `Allow: /`, but sites with admin panels, API endpoints, draft/preview pages, or private directories should disallow those paths.

2. **"Do you want to block AI training crawlers?"** If yes, see [reference.md S1.4](reference.md#14-search-engine-files) for the full bot list. **Tip:** Allow search-only bots (`OAI-SearchBot`, `PerplexityBot`) while blocking training bots.

**Basic robots.txt** (adjust `Disallow` lines based on user answers):
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://[domain]/sitemap.xml
```

**sitemap.xml** (`changefreq`/`priority` are ignored by Google; only `lastmod` matters if consistently accurate):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://[domain]/</loc>
    <lastmod>[YYYY-MM-DD]</lastmod>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

### Phase 1 Checklist
- [ ] `<html lang="en">` set
- [ ] `<title>` (50-60 chars)
- [ ] `<meta name="description">` (150-160 chars)
- [ ] `<link rel="canonical">` absolute URL
- [ ] `<meta name="theme-color">`
- [ ] All `og:*` tags with absolute URLs
- [ ] All `twitter:*` tags (except `twitter:url`)
- [ ] `favicon.ico` (32x32)
- [ ] `icon.svg` (scalable)
- [ ] `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- [ ] `social-card.jpg` (1200x630)
- [ ] `robots.txt`
- [ ] `sitemap.xml`

---

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Recommended)

### 2.1 Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Add to `<head>` after Twitter tags. Choose the schema based on **site type**:

| Site Type | Schema `@type` |
|-----------|---------------|
| Game | `["VideoGame", "WebApplication"]` (co-typing required for Google rich results) |
| Web app | `"WebApplication"` |
| Art site / Gallery | `"WebSite"` (homepage) or `"VisualArtwork"` (individual pieces) |
| Blog/Article | `"Blog"` or `"Article"` |
| Personal site / Portfolio | `"ProfilePage"` with `"Person"` mainEntity |
| Business | `"LocalBusiness"` or `"Organization"` |
| Documentation | `"WebSite"` with `"potentialAction": "SearchAction"` (if search works) |

See [reference.md S2.1](reference.md#21-structured-data-json-ld) for complete JSON-LD templates for each type.

### 2.2 PWA Support (Optional - Ask User)

**Ask the user:** "Would you like PWA support? This makes your site installable as an app on mobile/desktop, with optional offline support. Recommended for interactive apps and games; usually unnecessary for blogs, portfolios, or documentation sites."

**If the user wants PWA**, implement all of the following:

#### 2.2a Manifest

Create `manifest.json` with `id`, `name`, `short_name`, `display`, `icons`, `screenshots`, and `shortcuts`. Add `<link rel="manifest">` and `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable">` to `<head>`. Create `icon-192.png` (192x192) and `icon-512.png` (512x512). See [reference.md S2.2](reference.md#22-pwa-manifest) for the complete manifest template.

#### 2.2b Service Worker (Strongly Recommended for PWA)

A service worker is **strongly recommended** for a full PWA experience. While modern browsers (Chrome 112+) can show install prompts with just a manifest, a service worker is needed for offline support, caching, and passing Lighthouse PWA audits.

Create `sw.js` in the project root with a cache-first strategy for static assets and network-first for navigation. Register it from the main HTML file. See [reference.md S2.3](reference.md#23-service-worker) for the complete service worker code and registration snippet.

Key requirements:
- Site must be served over HTTPS (localhost exempt)
- `sw.js` must be in the root (or scope it with `Service-Worker-Allowed` header)
- Cache name should include a version string for easy cache busting
- Must handle the `install`, `activate`, and `fetch` events
- Should precache the app shell (HTML, CSS, JS, icons)
- Should provide an offline fallback for navigation requests

#### 2.2c PWA Icons and Screenshots

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `icon-192.png` | 192x192 | Android/PWA |
| `icon-512.png` | 512x512 | PWA splash/install |
| `screenshot-wide.png` | 1280x720 | PWA install preview (desktop) |
| `screenshot-mobile.png` | 750x1334 | PWA install preview (mobile) |

**If user declines PWA**, skip 2.2 entirely and move to 2.3.

### 2.3 Share Button

Implement Web Share API with clipboard fallback. Requirements: HTTPS (localhost exempt), user gesture trigger. Fallback chain: `navigator.share()` -> `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` -> selectable text element. See [reference.md S2.4](reference.md#24-share-button-implementation) for complete code.

**Ask the user** what content should be shareable (the page URL, a result/score, a custom message, etc.) to tailor the share functionality.

### Phase 2 Checklist
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data added (type matches site)
- [ ] **If PWA:** `manifest.json` created and linked
- [ ] **If PWA:** `sw.js` service worker created
- [ ] **If PWA:** Service worker registered in HTML
- [ ] **If PWA:** `icon-192.png` (192x192)
- [ ] **If PWA:** `icon-512.png` (512x512)
- [ ] **If PWA:** PWA screenshots created (wide + narrow)
- [ ] **If PWA:** `mobile-web-app-capable` meta added
- [ ] Share button implemented
- [ ] Clipboard fallback with visual feedback
- [ ] Share content includes URL

---

## Phase 3: Shareable Result Links

Only implement if users have content/state worth sharing that others should view (scores, configurations, results, selections, etc.).

**Ask the user:** "Do your users have results, configurations, or content they'd want to share via URL? For example: game scores, quiz results, saved configurations, curated selections." This helps determine if Phase 3 is needed and what state to encode.

1. **Encode state** into a short URL parameter (`?s=base36encoded`)
2. **Parse parameter** on page load, before normal initialization
3. **Display shared view** (read-only — NEVER overwrite user's localStorage)
4. **Show "shared content" messaging** so viewer knows it's not their data
5. **Provide CTA** (e.g., "Try it yourself!") that cleans the URL parameter

See [reference.md S3.3](reference.md#33-implementation-approach) for state encoding/decoding code and shared results landing page implementation. See [reference.md S3.4](reference.md#34-localstorage-safety) for localStorage safety wrapper.

### Phase 3 Checklist
- [ ] State encoding/decoding implemented
- [ ] URL parameter parsing (`?s=...`)
- [ ] Share link generation function
- [ ] Shared content display (read-only)
- [ ] "Shared content" messaging shown
- [ ] CTA button cleans URL
- [ ] User localStorage NEVER overwritten by shared state
- [ ] Decoded state validated before use

## Platform Cache Notes

When updating social cards, add version parameter: `social-card.jpg?v=2`

Force refresh tools:
- Facebook/Threads: [Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
- Twitter/X: Compose a draft post with the URL (public validator removed 2022)
- LinkedIn: [Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
- Mastodon: No universal tool (each instance caches independently)
- Bluesky: Client-side fetching (no centralized cache to bust)

See [reference.md Platform-Specific Notes](reference.md#platform-specific-notes) for full platform quirks and cache behavior.
